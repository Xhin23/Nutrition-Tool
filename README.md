=== Features of the Nutrition Tool include ===

* Getting nutritional information on a specific food in a variety of common or custom measurements
* Ranking foods by a specific nutrient
* Comparing the nutrient information of specific foods, including with a visually accesible graph
* Looking at or sorting/filtering by ratios between nutrients
* Ranking foods while other nutrient filters are present (for example looking at foods highest in vitamin C which also contain more than 30g of protein)
* Some custom-designed fields not available in other databases, for example "Net carbs" or a "Micronutrient Score" that aggregates daily values together.
* Setting custom RDAs and then filtering foods that meet certain percentages of them
